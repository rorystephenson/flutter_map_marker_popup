## [0.3.0] - 17/05/21

* PopupMarkerPlugin is removed and PopupMarkerPluginWidget is added. This plugin
  should now be added to FlutterMap as one of the 'children' instead of being
  added as a plugin.
* Showing/hiding of popups can now use a fade animation with a customisable duration and curve.
* Removed deprecated PopupSnap values, they have been replaced as follows:
  * left -> markerLeft
  * top -> markerTop
  * right -> markerRight
  * bottom -> markerBottom

## [0.2.1] - 05/03/21

* Move demo gif to separate repo so that the gif is not included when downloading this package.
* Updated demo gif to show new snapping behaviour.
* Added some thanks and links to related repos in READEME.md.
* Add documentation to make pub.dev happy.
* Add trailing newline to PopupSnap to make pub.dev happy.

## [0.2.0] - 18/02/21

* New dialog-snapping options added. Can now be snapped to the map rather than
  just the marker. Old marker snapping options have been deprecated in favour of
  more specific enums, so `left` now becomes `markerLeft` etc.

## [0.1.4] - 23/04/20

* Fix bug where the popup state did not change when selected another marker when the popup was already showing.
* Add showPopupFor(Marker) method to PopupController if the user wants plain show behaviour instead of toggle behaviour.

## [0.1.3] - 22/04/20

* Move `PopupBuilder` to its own file and export it in `extension_api.dart` so that it can be used without having to import the layer options.

## [0.1.2] - 22/04/20

* Possible to hide any of a list of markers. If the popup is showing for any of the provided markers it will be hidden. Otherwise nothing happens.
* Added `extension_api.dart` to be imported by plugins extending this one. This is initially for `flutter_map_marker_cluster`.

## [0.1.1] - 20/04/20

* Add example gif

## [0.1.0] - 20/04/20

* Complete rewrite. Now PopupMarkerLayer is a replacement for MarkerLayer and
  is not compatible with the clustering plugin. Popups for the clustering plugin
  will be proposed via PR on the marker clustering project.

* More detailed description
* Improve README.md

## [0.0.2] - 17/04/20
