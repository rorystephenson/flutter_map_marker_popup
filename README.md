Makes adding marker popups to [`flutter_map`](https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map) easy.

If you have any suggestions/problems please don't hesitate to open an issue.

## Clustering

If you want both marker popups and marker clustering, this plugin's popup functionality has been integrated in to the wonderful [flutter_map_marker_cluster](https://github.com/lpongetti/flutter_map_marker_cluster) plugin.

## Thanks

A huge thanks to the contributors of `flutter_map` and the `flutter_map_marker_popup`. I use them together in a large personal project and they work wonderfully.
